# FoscamViewerUWP
View your foscam camera with Windows 10 IoT

This UWP app does manage (sub)streams of modern Foscam camera's (I tried it with models FI9900 and FI9853). I use it myself on a Raspbery PI-3B with Windows 10 IoT

It uses the VLC.MediaElement for UWP, the MediaElement clone powered by VLC.

Requires Windows 10 Anniversary Edition and matching Windows SDK.
